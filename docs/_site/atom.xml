This power bank then drives both the “status” display on the chest (an audio frequency tracking app on an old smartphone) as well as the RGB LED lighting which emanates from under both shoulder pads. The chest electronics are hidden beneath hand-molded thermoplastic and all power hookups travel through wire salvaged from CAT network cables (as is a common theme in my reclaimed projects).

Each year in October, the Black Label bicycle crew throws this event somewhere in Brooklyn (or sometimes Queens). Some kind of strange hybrid of a demolition derby, a block party, and a mutant vehicle parade, all with a hint of Mad Max mixed in, Bike Kill is a day to imbibe and rejoice with other bicycle, metalworking, and/or art enthusiasts. Black Label builds a large number of these “freak bikes” over the year, then bring them to the event - however, everyone is encouraged to participate. After several years of wanting to make a freak bike of my own, myself and two friends decided 2019 was the year. We came up with a plan to build a “swing bike,” a bike which has a turning system similar to the front of the bike on the rear end as well. Using the carcasses of 3 stripped, rusting, twisted, and forgotten bicycles plus components from my personal parts bin (I’m a former professional bicycle mechanic and permanent bicycle enthusiast) we sliced up the frames with an angle grinder, serviced the parts that needed it, cobbled things together best we could, then got out the MIG stuck it all together. The result was remarkably good considering we didn’t test the frame’s geometry with wheels until it was completely finished. Although the bottom bracket was lower than desired due to the far-too-aggressive head tube angle, the bike was rideable as intended (and one of the more rideable bikes at bike kill that year). Unlike many Bike Kill bikes, ours survived and lives with one of the friends who collaborated on this project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="carpentry" /><category term="mechanics" /><category term="plumbing" /><category term="electrical" /><category term="bus" /><summary type="html">Bike Kill has long been a personal favorite holiday.

The idea was born when I stumbled upon a water-logged arcade cabinet on the side of the road and I thought back to the DDR/House of the Dead dual game cabinet I built as a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using my trusty leatherman I was able to remove the controls panel and carry this home - I considered this likely to be the most difficult to find component group. The “cabinet” is made from a found sheet of acrylic and has the ability to be used in either stand-alone mode (plug into HDMI display device, games on internal Raspberry Pi) or as an external USB controller for another device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mode can be selected via buttons on the back of the cabinet (electrically controlled by a modified RCA switch). Because of the self-imposed limitation of using only found materials destined for the landfill, this project took around a year to complete - much of this was spent waiting to find ideal candidates for parts. This project was intended to be a functional art piece, demonstrating the amount of still usable and potentially valuable electronic waste ends up in the garbage and was to be showcased at a (cancelled) e-waste summit but now instead resides in my living room.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="carpentry" /><category term="mechanics" /><category term="plumbing" /><category term="electrical" /><category term="bus" /><summary type="html">This project is a fully functional bar-top style arcade made entirely from materials found in the trash (exceptions: solder, glue, and some of the hardware).

Because the size of the drone was quite small, limiting added weight was a priority, the device needed to be stripped as much as possible. The internals were removed from their plastics, the display was done away with, the user interface button removed. The li-ion battery was discarded in favor of jacking power directly from the drone’s 3.3v power line (a small firmware modification was also necessary to prevent a low-battery warning). The most open section of the drone’s internals were chosen for mounting the added hardware, and an orientation was found that would allow the original micro-USB port to be accessed (for firmware changes and device configuration via computer). Regardless of the orientation or location, however, part of the board would need to be trimmed down to allow for proper clearance and thus allow for reassembly of the drone. With access to the schematics for the device, I was able to confirm that portions of the board being removed would either not damage traces on any of the internal layers of the board, or would only affect disused portions of the system (such as the charging circuit). Finally, the board was wrapped in polyimide tape, glued in place, and the drone was re-assembled. Externally, the only indication of any modification at all was the externally-accessible micro USB port, and the drone’s flight was unaffected.

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the interior was made from salvaged materials with some exceptions. Completion of the project demanded I learn many new skills while testing the ones I already had. This included the carpentry of the interior, wiring of the solar and interior electrical (both AC and DC), mechanical and plumbing work on the vegetable oil system to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the braking system unexpectedly needed a full overhaul, so I got to learn a lot about Lucas-Girling braking systems. Ultimately, I lived on the bus for over 3 years and traveled over 2000 miles on it in that time. I sold the bus in 2016 to a vacationing German family who then took her another thousand miles over several months. Last I heard, the bus was driven to Brazil where it is now someone’s home.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="carpentry" /><category term="mechanics" /><category term="plumbing" /><category term="electrical" /><category term="bus" /><summary type="html">This was one of my largest projects still to this date.
